             <p>I3DA 2026 will again focus on innovation in 3D immersive audio, including virtual acoustics, architectural and musical acoustics, subjective evaluations and listening tests, immersive soundscape design, and creative uses of immersive technologies. Furthermore, I3DA 2026 will be a special edition, that will include visual and interactive aspects of immersive media, such as related computer graphics, LIDAR scans, photogrammetry, immersive world building, digital archaeology, 3D visualization, and hardware and software applications across both fields. The aim is to open new possibilities for collaboration, networking, and deeper understanding between complementary sensory domains in immersive media.</p>
            <p>I3DA 2026 would like to involve academic and industrial researchers to share their latest research, methods, and demos related to Immersive and 3D Audio, Interaction Design and Visuals in Audio Engineering, Computer Science and Visuals. Topics include virtual/augmented reality and their applications, digital archaeology, musical acoustics, signal processing in acoustics, non-linear acoustics in auralisation, machine learning related to immersive media, acoustics, heritage acoustics, psychoacoustics, gaming, art and sound studies contexts, bioacoustics and the environment. Further topics may be accepted.</p>
            <p>I3DA will be indexed on IEEE like the last years, with Special Issues like last year.</p>
            <p>The conference will represent the forefront of new methodologies and technologies in the field, establishing itself as a high-profile international meeting point for researchers and professionals in immersive media and 3D audio. This event will foster meaningful international collaborations—across academia, industry, heritage and museum institutions, the arts, and environmental initiatives—while driving forward innovation in immersive media.</p>
